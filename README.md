# Standardized Test Analysis

## Background

Despite being the technological powerhouse of United States and the 5th highest state in terms of GDP per capita, California seems to underperform when it comes to quality of pre-tertiary education.

It ranks 40th in the quality of pre-K12<sup>1</sup> education ([usnews](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education)) and 41th in quality of public schools ([wallethub](https://wallethub.com/edu/e/states-with-the-best-schools/5335)). This is not for the lack of educational spending either, as the state ranks 20th in terms of education budget.

There is therefore an urgency to take a more targeted approach in terms of where and how the money is spent. 

## Problem Statement

The state of California has many school districts. This project aims to identify the districts that have the worst overall student performance on the SAT and ACT tests so the state can recommend programs and allocate resources to these districts in need.
