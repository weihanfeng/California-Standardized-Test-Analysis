    "Despite being the technological powerhouse of United States and the 5th highest state in terms of GDP per capita, California seems to underperform when it comes to quality of pre-tertiary education. It ranks 40th in the quality of pre-K12<sup>1</sup> education ([usnews](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education)) and 41th in quality of public schools ([wallethub](https://wallethub.com/edu/e/states-with-the-best-schools/5335)). This is not for the lack of education resources either, as the state ranks 20th in terms of education spending. There is therefore an inefficient utilisation of education spendings and an urgency to take a more targeted approach in terms of where and how the money is spent.\n",

    "For this project, the main metrics which will be used to to assess student performance are SAT and ACT results for each school district. The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university. \n",

    "The state of California has many school districts. This project aims to analyse the student performances on SAT and ACT tests with regards to a number of socio-economic indicators of each district. This helps to identify underlying factors which contributes to potential poor performances so that states can take a more targeted approach in allocating resources and recommending interventions in areas of concern.
