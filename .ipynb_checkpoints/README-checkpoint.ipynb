    "Despite being the technological powerhouse of United States and the 5th highest state in terms of GDP per capita, California seems to underperform when it comes to quality of pre-tertiary education. It ranks 40th in the quality of pre-K12<sup>1</sup> education ([usnews](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education)) and 41th in quality of public schools ([wallethub](https://wallethub.com/edu/e/states-with-the-best-schools/5335)). This is not for the lack of education resources either, as the state ranks 20th in terms of education spending. There is therefore an inefficient utilisation of education spendings and an urgency to take a more targeted approach in terms of where and how the money is spent.\n",

    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",

    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

Although the Covid-19 pandemic have promopted some US universities to make ACT or SAT non-mandatory for the 2020 admission cycle, they are making a comeback as normality resumes. \n",

    "The state of California has many school districts, with varying ACT and SAT performances. In order to improve the performances in these standardized tests, it is often not enough to just increase funding and resources to districts with poorer performances without identifying the underlying reasons behind the poor results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyse the student performances on SAT and ACT tests with regards to a number of socio-economic indicators of each district. This helps to identify underlying factors which contributes to potential poor performances so that the state can take a more targeted approach in allocating funds and resources, as well as recommending interventions in areas of concern. \n",

    "**Allocation of education expenditure:**\n",
    "- More education expenditure should be allocated especially to those districts with less than 10,000 USD\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic:**\n",
    "- Improving the economic well-being of an area is a long term endeavor. On the shorter term, more resources should be dedicated to lower income families\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethnic**:  \n",
    "- More help should be focused on Hispanic/Latino as well as Black Americans\n",
    "- A separate research can be conducted to investigate what Asian American families are doing right to achieve higher standardized score\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broadband Access:**\n",
    "- provide subsidized broadband services in order to lower then barrier of access to information and knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Household type:**\n",
    "- Increase provision of career advice, counselling and after school care to districts with lower percentage of married households. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Geographical:**\n",
    "- Focus help on town and rural areas, especially inland areas.\n",
